Many slicers have a "gap closing" feature, to heal small gaps.

On Prusa and Bambu slicer, this setting is called "Slice gap closing radius", and is found under the Quality tab -> Precision heading.

The snap-outs in this design require changing this from the default of 0.049 mm to 0.02 mm in order to print with the right semi-fused thin gaps.

These gaps are optimized for PLA and have not been tested with other filaments.

They are optimized for 0.2 mm layer height and 0.42 mm line width, which are common defaults.

The version with a shelf works best with manual (default style) support painted under the shelf. Disable all other supports - they're not needed if your printer can handle 45 degree overhangs and typical bridging.
