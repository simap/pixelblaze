We print these in PLA and have not tested with other filaments.

They are optimized for 0.2 mm layer height and 0.42 mm line width, which are common defaults.

The version with a shelf works best with manual (default style) support painted under the shelf. Disable all other supports - they're not needed if your printer can handle 45 degree overhangs and typical bridging.
