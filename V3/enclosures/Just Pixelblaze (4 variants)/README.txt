This fusion design uses the Configurations feature to include 4 enclosure variants in a single design, as well as a mounting cradle that works with any of them.

Typical LED strips use JST-SM 3 or 4 pin connectors, the black ones with a retaining notch. Traditionally you would need to solder a screw terminal to your Pixelblaze (or solder the JST-SM directly to the circuit board).

We now offer a pre-soldered ("no soldering required") version of Pixelblaze with a JST-XH pre-installed on the underside of the circuit board. The JST-XH is a small white connector with no retaining notch. We offer a variety of adapters to convert this JST-XH to many different JST-SM connectors and their many different possible pin assignments, so you can connect to any typical LEDs you find without any soldering.

The Ready-to-Run (R2R) enclosure design is for use with this "no soldering required" Pixelblaze, and only has an opening on the bottom for a JST-XH. The side has an opening for the optional (2.1A max) USB power connection.

The Flexible Connection design allows three configurations: 

1) The traditional screw terminal soldered to the board's top side
2) A JST-XH soldered on the board's top side
3) A JST-XH soldered on the board's bottom side, just like the Ready-to-Run version

For the Flexible Connection design, you snap out the plastic for any output openings you need to expose, as well as the optional USB power-in connection.

Both the Ready-to-Run and Flexible connections designs come with an optional strain relief shelf on the output side. You can use a small zip tie to tighten your output wires to this. For the JST-XH, this might be a good idea since they can be pulled out with moderate force.

While the slide-in lids should stay in place via a friction fit design, they include a hole for a M2x8mm self-tapping or wood screw.

The Mounting Cradle lets you snap-in any of the above 4 configurations and gives you:

1) Holes for M2.5-M4 screws
2) Variable-width slots for using smaller screws, removable hanging on a wall, or mounting to a pole (e.g. bike) with zip ties
3) An optional output strain relief shelf, so you can add this feature later to the shells versions
4) A strain relief platform for your USB power connection, which also accepts a zip tie
